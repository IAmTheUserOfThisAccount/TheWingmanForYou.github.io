				Are you a shy guy?
				Are you what some people may describe as an "incel", nerd, socially awkward or just a generally shy guy around women in NYC?
				Do you get anxiety around women and don't know how to approach and talk to them, but want to change that?
				For a price I can be your wingman and try to help. 
				No guarantees and refunds for this service, and only physical cash is accepted, but what I can tell you is I will be in the trenches with you.
